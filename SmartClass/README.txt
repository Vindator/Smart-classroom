----------------------- Smart Classroom v1.0 ----------------------


How to upload sketch

1) Copy all libraries to C:\Users\DELL\Documents\Arduino\Libraries
2) Start Arduino IDE 
3) Open the SmartClass.ino
4) Chouse your arduino port(t.ex. COM6, but you need to check it in device Manager)
5) And finaly upload sketch


It is the 1.0 version of this project, but I`m going to optimise it with a time.
